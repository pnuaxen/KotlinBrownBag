# KotlinBrownBag

I will lead the first meeting where we refine the participation guidelines. I will also demo a feature branch addition. No magic here to start, the first commit to master is just a basic Android Studio 3.0 starter project. 

Brown Bag Goals
1. Learn Kotlin!
2. Learn Unit Testing in Kotlin.
3. Have fun!
4. Create a Driver/Worker applet?
5. Have fun! Did you know that "More than 17% of the projects in Android Studio 3.0 are now using Kotlin."? See https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2017/11/update-on-kotlin-for-android.html


Brown Bag Protocol

There is no such thing as passive learning, especially with a new programming language. You have to try it out. You have to participate. Your participation should require less than an hour a week. You wait around for Visual Studio builds longer than that each week....

After each meeting, contributors can choose to participate in the next session by doing the following:
1. Clone master or update to the latest master.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Add one small feature that demonstrates something you taught yourself about Kotlin. You need to be able to explain the feature and teach the Kotlin in 5-8 minutes or less.
4. Add at least one unit test to the project, preferably testing what you just added.

During each meeting, participants will:
1. Demo their feature and teach the Kotlin in 5-8 minutes or less. Demo the unit test.
2. After all the demos, we vote on the feature to merge to master.
3. Developer merges his/her feature to master.
4. Rinse and repeat.

At the end of a while we will all have learned Kotlin, AND maybe, we will have a cool new useful driver/worker app written entirely in Kotlin.
